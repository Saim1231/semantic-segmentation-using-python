# semantic-segmentation-using-python

This repository contains an implementation of semantic segmentation using a pre-trained PyTorch model. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves assigning a class label to each pixel in an image, thus enabling detailed understanding and analysis of the image's content. By leveraging a pre-trained model, we achieve accurate and efficient segmentation results.
